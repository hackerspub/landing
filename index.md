## Welcome to Hackerspub

We are building the largest community of hackers to help secure all things technology. As a community, we will identify and share vulnabilities in heavily used/relied upon systems and applications, we will share patches/resolutions to the vulnabilities if and when we figure them out. It's every organizations' responsibility to keep their systems and platforms safe for their users and clients.

There's no such a thing as a bullet proof system and no one individual or organization knows all their weakneses and how to resolve them. It takes a community, this community to bring out the best in us from all over the world.

If you want to contribute to this universal good cause, reach out with your contributions by emailing us: h4ck3rspub@gmail.com

In the email include:

-What the vulnabilitiy is and which system, software, platform, application, etc
-
-How to reproduce the vulnability 
-
-The fix if you have identified so that the community can verify it
-
-How to reach you in case there's a REWARD
-
-Any other details
